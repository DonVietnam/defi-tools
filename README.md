## Dex Position Calculator

The **Dex Position Calculator** allows you to:

- Compute how much of each token to deposit into a Dex;
- Determine required swaps for optimal LP positioning;
- Simulate strategies with lending: supply one token as collateral and borrow another without selling core assets;

This tool helps long-term holders avoid unnecessary token sales while still maximizing LP efficiency.
